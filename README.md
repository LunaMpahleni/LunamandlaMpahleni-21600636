3D Building Visualization using Cesium
This repository contains a project that visualizes 3D buildings using CesiumJS. The project loads GeoJSON data, applies extrusions to buildings, and provides a realistic view of the urban landscape. The code also integrates Cesium Ion services for rendering and manipulation of geospatial data.
